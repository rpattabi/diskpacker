This page describes the basic usage of [DiskPacker]

= Introduction =

[DiskPacker] is a Ruby script. At present there are no pre-compiled binaries (exe file for windows etc). One can run it from the source.

You just give the list of directories which has your files or other directories you intend to backup. This is what you get back from [DiskPacker] in return:

  * It will give you optimized list of files and directories for the given type of disk (e.g. CD or DVD).
  * It will also generate the project files for some of the well known disk burning softwares in windows and linux. You can readily use open these projects in the burning softwares to burn the disks. (Currently Infrarecorder, and Brasero are supported. K3B support is on the way)
  * [DiskPacker] also generates shell script (and batch file for windows) which you can run if you want to delete the files you have just backed up if you want.

= Details =

  * Get the source :  `svn checkout http://diskpacker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ diskpacker`
  * _input_paths.txt_ is the place where you can fill in the paths to your source directories. (This file is located under folder _lib_ inside _diskpacker_)


For instance, on a windows system input_paths.txt can be like this:

    C:\MY DOCUMENTS\MY DOWNLOADS
    d:/movies
    c:\my documents/my pictures

Alternatively, on a linux system

    /home/username/Documents
    /home/username/Downloads

  * Run main.rb with the following command `ruby main.rb`
  * Output files are generated in the same directory (_lib_)
    * *Report* A report is generated with information about how many disks you need to backup all your stuff and which files go in which disks, free space in each disks, etc. You can use this info to backup your files manually. (_bin_packed_windows.txt_ and _bin_packed_linux.txt_ are generated now in order to accommodate file path differences)
    * *Generated Disk Burning Projects* 
      * *windows only* Infrarecorder projects are generated viz., _BACKUP_0.irp, BACKUP_1.irp, etc_. You can open these files in Infrarecorder, a opensource cd/dvd burner for windows, to burn your CD/DVDs.
      * *linux only* Brasero projects are generated viz., _brasero_BACKUP_0.xml, _brasero_BACKUP_1.xml, etc_. You can open these files in Brasero, a opensource cd/dvd burner for linux GNOME desktop. It is also now the default burner in Ubuntu.
    * *Eraser scripts*
      * *windows only* Batch files are generated to erase the files after backup if desired viz., _delete_backup_set_0.bat, _delete_backup_set_1.bat, etc_. _delete_backup_set_0.bat_ has code to erase files that are included in _BACKUP_0.irp_ or _id=0_ section in _bins_packed_windows.txt_
      * *linux only* Shell scripts are generated to erase the files after backup if desired viz., _delete_backup_set_0.sh, _delete_backup_set_1.sh, etc_. _delete_backup_set_0.sh_ has code to erase files that are included in _brasero_BACKUP_0.xml_ or _id=0_ section in _bins_packed_linux.txt_
