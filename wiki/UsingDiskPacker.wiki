This page describes the basic usage of _DiskPacker_

= Introduction =

_DiskPacker_ is a Ruby script. At present there are no pre-compiled binaries (exe file for windows etc). One can run it from the source.

You just give the list of directories which has your files or other directories you intend to backup. This is what you get back from _DiskPacker_ in return:

  * It will give you optimized list of files and directories for the given type of disk (e.g. CD or DVD).
  * It will also generate the project files for some of the well known disk burning softwares in windows and linux. You can readily use open these projects in the burning softwares to burn the disks. (Currently Infrarecorder, and Brasero are supported. K3B support is on the way)
  * _DiskPacker_ also generates shell script (and batch file for windows) which you can run if you want to delete the files you have just backed up if you want.

= Details =

  * Get the source :  `svn checkout http://diskpacker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ diskpacker`
  * _input_paths.txt_ is the place where you can fill in the paths to your source directories. (This file is located under folder _lib_ inside _diskpacker_)


For instance, on a windows system input_paths.txt can be like this:

{{{
C:\MY DOCUMENTS\MY DOWNLOADS
d:/movies
c:\my documents/my pictures
}}}

Alternatively, on a linux system

{{{
/home/username/Documents
/home/username/Downloads
}}}

  * Run main.rb: `ruby main.rb`
  * Output files are generated in the same directory (_lib_)
    * _bin_packed.txt_ --> shows how many disks you need to backup all your stuff (as specified in _input_paths.txt_) and which files go in which disks, freespace in each disks etc. You can use this info to backup your files manually. (_bin_packed_windows.txt_ and _bin_packed_linux.txt_ are generated now in order to accommodate file path differences)
    * *windows only* _BACKUP_0.irp, BACKUP_1.irp, etc_ --> Infrarecorder project files. You can open these files in Infrarecorder (Opensource cd/dvd burner for windows) to burn your CD/DVDs.
    * *windows only* _delete_backup_set_0.bat, _delete_backup_set_1.bat, etc_ --> batch files to erase files after backup. _delete_backup_set_0.bat_ has code to erase files that are included in _BACKUP_0.irp_ or *id=0* section in _bins_packed_windows.txt_
    * *linux only* _brasero_BACKUP_0.xml, _brasero_BACKUP_1.xml, brasero_BACKUP_2.xml, etc_ -> Brasero project files. You can open these files in Brasero (Opensource cd/dvd burner for GNOME. Default burner in Ubuntu) to burn your CD/DVDs.
    * *linux only* _delete_backup_set_0.sh, _delete_backup_set_1.sh, etc_ --> shell scripts to erase files after backup. _delete_backup_set_0.sh_ has code to erase files that are included in _brasero_BACKUP_0.xml_ or *id=0* section in _bins_packed_linux.txt_
